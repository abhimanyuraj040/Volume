#Volume Control Using Hand Gesture
i have used python modules like opencv, pycaw and mediapipe to develope this project.
you can control volume of your system by using your finger tips.
like if you bring your index and thumb closer the volume of your system then the volume of your system
will start decreasing and vice versa for increasing volume of your system.
enjoy!!!!
